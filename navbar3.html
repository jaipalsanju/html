      <p> In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
        Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still
        exist in HTML 4.[8]

        HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into
        visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser,
        and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
        the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn
        covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the
        early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were
        derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of
        generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print
        effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction
        with CSS.</p>
